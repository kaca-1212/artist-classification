# Artist Identification with SVM and CNN

This repo contains the code used to perform artist identification of paintings in Python. Both an SVM and CNN approach are included. The SVM approach involves the extraction of multiple image feature descriptors, including the GIST descriptors, SIFT keypoints, and color histograms, while the CNN approach uses a simple CNN architecture to make predictions.
